This is the private note to the Core Team that explains how your app (Checkers4Pi) provides real utility to Pioneers.

The Pi Core Team's focus in 2026 has shifted heavily toward "Action and Building." They are looking for apps that keep Pioneers engaged within the Pi Browser and prove that the ecosystem can support high-quality, functional software beyond just mining.

Developer Statement for Checkers4Pi
To the Pi Network App Review Board,

Project Overview: 
I am submitting Checkers4Pi, a high-performance, mobile-optimized strategy game built specifically for the Pi Network ecosystem. The app features a custom-built AI engine utilizing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, providing Pioneers with a challenging and intellectually stimulating experience directly within the Pi Browser.

Utility to the Pi Ecosystem:
Pioneer Engagement: Checkers4Pi provides a consistent, high-utility "Attention Economy" use case. By offering three levels of AI difficulty, the app encourages daily user retention and long-term engagement, contributing to the overall vibrancy of the Pi Browser.

Technical Excellence & SDK Integration: 
The app is built with a focus on "clean code" standards, utilizing the latest React patterns and the Pi SDK for seamless authentication. It demonstrates that the Pi Network can host professional-grade gaming software that rivals standalone mobile apps.

Mobile-First Accessibility: 
Recognizing that the majority of Pioneers access the network via mobile devices, every aspect of Checkers4Pi—from touch-target sizes to the "Amethyst and Gold" color palette—has been optimized for the mobile web-view, ensuring a zero-latency, "native-feel" experience.

Commitment to Sustainability & Non-Monetization: 
I would like to explicitly state that Checkers4Pi contains no monetization. There are no in-app purchases, no advertisements, and no plans to add any in the future.

My goal is to provide a pure, high-quality utility tool for the community that strengthens the network's value proposition without introducing financial friction or "ad-fatigue" for Pioneers. This is a community-first contribution designed to showcase the power of the Pi App platform.

Thank you for your time and for your dedication to building a utility-driven future for Pi.

Sincerely, b-r-s
