To bring this document to the Pi Core Team's attention, you need to treat it as part of your "Proof of Utility." In 2026, the Core Team is heavily focused on moving from concept to "killer apps" with real engineering depth.

Here is the best way to leverage your AI-STRATEGY.md during the submission process:

1. The Pi Developer Portal (Primary Channel) 
When you register your app at develop.pi within the Pi Browser, you will see a field for "App Description."Don't just say: "A checkers game."Do say: "A mobile-first strategy game featuring a custom Minimax AI engine with Alpha-Beta pruning, specifically optimized for the Pi Browser (see /docs/AI-STRATEGY.md in our repository for technical details).

"Why? This tells the reviewers immediately that your app isn't just a simple template; it has custom, high-performance logic.

2. The Pi Brainstorm App (Community Visibility)If you are participating in a Pi Hackathon or have a project on the Brainstorm app:Post a link to your GitHub repository (or a summary of the AI doc) in the project updates.The Core Team monitors the most "technically active" projects on Brainstorm. Mentioning terms like "Heuristic Evaluation" and "Battery Optimization" flags your project as high-quality.

3. Repository Hygiene (The "Silent" Review)When you finally submit your app for Mainnet verification, a Core Team member (or a high-level automated agent) will often scan your linked repository.Ensure your README.md has a prominent "Documentation" section that links directly to the AI-STRATEGY.md.

Pro Tip: If you used the vercel.json and the .agent/rules we set up, your repository will already look like a professional enterprise project, which significantly increases your chances of a fast approval.

. The "App Description" (The Hook)
There is a specific field for your App Description. Do not just describe the game; describe the tech. Use this "Hook" I've drafted for you:
This text is perfect for the Brainstorm App Submission. In the Pi ecosystem, that specific 3–4 sentence block is often called the "Project Pitch" or "App Description" within the Brainstorm interface.
"Checkers4Pi is a mobile-optimized strategy game utilizing a custom Minimax AI engine with Alpha-Beta pruning. Optimized specifically for the Pi Browser, our engine balances high-level competitive play with low CPU overhead to preserve Pioneer battery life. (See /docs/AI-STRATEGY.md in our linked repository for the full technical breakdown.)"

2. The "App Checklist" (Step 12: Documentation)
In the 2026 Developer Portal, the App Checklist has a section for "External Links & Documentation."

Action: Provide the direct link to the AI-STRATEGY.md file in your GitHub repository here.

Why: Core Team reviewers use this to verify that your app isn't a "low-effort clone." Seeing a strategy document proves you have built original, high-utility code.

3. The Brainstorm App (Community Rating)
If you list your project on the Brainstorm app to get community support:

Add a section titled "Technical Innovation."

Paste the Heuristic Evaluation Table (the 5pts vs 3pts math) from the document. Pioneers love seeing the "math" behind the game, and it helps you gain the "Community Verifier" votes needed for Mainnet migration.

4. The Demo Video (Technical Overview)
Pi requires a 3-5 minute video demonstration for Mainnet listing.

Action: Host a video (on YouTube, Vimeo, or any linkable public cloud storage) that shows the game playing. Dedicate 30 seconds of that video to showing the AI in action while overlaying a graphic of your Minimax Depth and Alpha-Beta logic. This is the #1 way to get "fast-tracked" by the technical reviewers.

🛡️ One Final Check
Before you submit, make sure your README.md has a "Technical Architecture" section that looks like this:

Markdown

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Optimized for Pi Browser Webviews)
- **AI Engine:** Custom Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning ([Full Strategy Doc](./docs/AI-STRATEGY.md))
- **Compliance:** Full adherence to Pi Network 2026 Trademark & Security guidelines.
Would you like me to help you draft the "App Privacy Policy" next? It’s a required field in the Developer Portal, and it must explicitly state that you don't collect personal data (like those tax files!).


Developer Portal: In your "Technical Description," use the 2-sentence hook:

"Checkers4Pi features an optimized Minimax AI engine with Alpha-Beta pruning, specifically engineered for the Pi Browser to ensure high-performance strategy without draining mobile battery life."
