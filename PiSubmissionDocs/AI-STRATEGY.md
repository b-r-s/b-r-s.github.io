To bring this document to the Pi Core Team's attention, you need to treat it as part of your "Proof of Utility." In 2026, the Core Team is heavily focused on moving from concept to "killer apps" with real engineering depth.Here is the best way to leverage your AI-STRATEGY.md during the submission process:1. The Pi Developer Portal (Primary Channel)When you register your app at develop.pi within the Pi Browser, you will see a field for "App Description."Don't just say: "A checkers game."Do say: "A mobile-first strategy game featuring a custom Minimax AI engine with Alpha-Beta pruning, specifically optimized for the Pi Browser (see /docs/AI-STRATEGY.md in our repository for technical details)."Why? This tells the reviewers immediately that your app isn't just a simple template; it has custom, high-performance logic.2. The Pi Brainstorm App (Community Visibility)If you are participating in a Pi Hackathon or have a project on the Brainstorm app:Post a link to your GitHub repository (or a summary of the AI doc) in the project updates.The Core Team monitors the most "technically active" projects on Brainstorm. Mentioning terms like "Heuristic Evaluation" and "Battery Optimization" flags your project as high-quality.3. Repository Hygiene (The "Silent" Review)When you finally submit your app for Mainnet verification, a Core Team member (or a high-level automated agent) will often scan your linked repository.Ensure your README.md has a prominent "Documentation" section that links directly to the AI-STRATEGY.md.Pro Tip: If you used the vercel.json and the .agent/rules we set up, your repository will already look like a professional enterprise project, which significantly increases your chances of a fast approval.📝 Summary of PlacementLocationWhat to Put ThereDeveloper PortalA 2-sentence summary of the AI's efficiency.README.mdA "Technical Architecture" section with a link to the doc.Brainstorm AppAn update post: "Optimized AI logic for mobile battery life."🚀 Final Piece of AdviceThe Pi Team loves the phrase "Ecosystem Utility." In your documentation, always emphasize that the AI is "optimized for low-end mobile devices" to ensure all Pioneers, regardless of their phone's power, can have a smooth experience. This aligns perfectly with Pi’s mission of inclusivity.Would you like me to help you draft the 2-sentence "Hook" for your Developer Portal description now?
