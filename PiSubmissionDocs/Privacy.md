# Privacy Policy for Checkers4Pi
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## 1. Our Privacy Philosophy
Checkers4Pi is built with a "Privacy by Design" approach. We believe that strategy games should be fun and secure, not a tool for data collection.

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect
- **Personal Identity:** We do not collect your real name, email, or phone number.
- **Financial Data:** We do not store or access your Pi Wallet private keys or seed phrases.
- **External Data:** We do not access your device's contacts, photos, or personal files (e.g., local documents).
- **Tracking:** We do not use third-party tracking cookies or advertising IDs.

## 3. Information We Process
To provide the game service within the Pi Network ecosystem, we only process:
- **Pi Username/UID:** Provided by the Pi SDK to identify you for the game leaderboard.
- **Game State:** Local data regarding your current checkers match (stored in your browser's local storage).
- **Technical Logs:** Standard server logs (IP address, browser type) used by our host (Vercel) solely for security and performance monitoring.

## 4. Data Storage & Security
All game-specific data (your move history and AI settings) is stored **locally on your device**. We do not maintain a central database of your personal gameplay.

## 5. Contact
For any privacy-related questions, please contact the developer via our GitHub repository issues page.
