# Mission Statement & Developer Commitment 💜🚀

To the Pi Network App Review Board and the Pioneer Community,

This document outlines the core mission and commitment behind the development of **Checkers4Pi**.

## Project Mission
Our goal is to provide a high-performance, intellectually stimulating strategy game built specifically for the Pi Network. We aim to prove that the Pi Browser can host professional-grade software that rivals standalone mobile applications, while keeping Pioneers engaged in a meaningful "Attention Economy."

## Key Commitments

### 1. Pioneer Engagement & Utility
Checkers4Pi is more than just a game; it's a utility tool for the community. By offering a custom-built AI engine (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning) across three difficulty levels, we provide a consistent reason for Pioneers to visit and interact within the Pi Browser daily.

### 2. Technical Excellence
The application is built using modern, clean-code standards (React 19 & TypeScript). Every touch target, animation, and color choice (Amethyst & Gold) has been optimized for the mobile web-view to ensure a "native-feel" with zero latency.

### 3. Sustainability & Zero-Monetization
**Checkers4Pi is, and will always be, 100% free for Pioneers.**
- ❌ No Advertisements
- ❌ No In-App Purchases
- ❌ No Personal Data Collection

We believe in a utility-driven future for Pi where high-quality tools are provided as a community-first contribution. This approach avoids "ad-fatigue" and ensures that the focus remains entirely on the strategic experience and network growth.
