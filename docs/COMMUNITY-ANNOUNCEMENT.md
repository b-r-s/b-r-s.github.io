# 📢 Project Announcement: Checkers4Pi

## 🚀 One-Sentence Pitch
A high-performance, battery-optimized Checkers dApp featuring an advanced Minimax AI engine, built specifically for the Pi Network ecosystem.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
Checkers4Pi brings professional-grade strategy to the Pi Browser. While many mobile games drain battery with unoptimized logic, Checkers4Pi uses a custom-built Minimax engine with Alpha-Beta pruning, specifically weighted for mobile performance. Our goal is to provide a seamless, competitive experience for Pioneers while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and network utility.

## ✨ Key Features for Pioneers
- **Advanced AI Strategy:** Choose from three difficulty levels powered by an optimized **3:2 King-to-Piece** weighting engine.
- **Pi-First Design:** Fully integrated with the Pi SDK for secure authentication and a custom "Amethyst Horizon" high-contrast theme.
- **Mandatory Jump Logic:** Strict adherence to Standard American Checkers rules for fair play.
- **Privacy-First:** Zero data collection. No access to personal files or tracking—just pure strategy.

## 🛠 Technical Innovation
- **Algorithm:** Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning (4-6 ply depth).
- **Optimization:** Integer-based heuristic calculations to reduce CPU load and preserve battery life on all mobile devices.
- **Compliance:** Built using the PiOS (Pi Open Source) license framework and 2026 Trademark guidelines.
